# **App Name**: ASR EDUCATIONAL notes

## Core Features:

- Category Creation: Create new categories (headers) for notes, each with a distinct, user-selected color theme.
- Rich Note Editor: Provide a rich-text editor for creating and formatting notes, with support for multiple languages, emojis, and rich text formatting (bold, italic, underline, lists, code blocks, blockquotes).
- Attachment Support: Allow users to attach and upload various file types (PDF, Word, Excel, images, etc.) and display them within the note, with options for preview or download.
- Intelligent Tagging Tool: Suggest relevant tags or headers based on the content of the note using an AI. Use an LLM tool to decide which tags and/or headers make most sense in the context of the content.
- Note Management: Enable users to search, edit, and delete notes, organized by category (header) with corresponding color-coded tags.
- Responsive Layout: Ensure the application is fully responsive and provides a clean, modern, mobile-friendly interface.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark, desaturated blue (#34495E) to evoke a sense of professionalism and focus without being boring. The subtle blue hue prevents it from feeling as stark as true black.
- Background color: Very dark, desaturated blue (#222F3A) so the background will sit comfortably behind the foreground content.
- Accent color: Analogous violet (#8E44AD), brighter and more saturated than the primary color, is used for category highlights and interactive elements, providing a visual cue without overwhelming the design.
- Body text and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif offering a blend of modern appeal with approachability.
- Use simple, flat icons that correspond to file types and editing actions. Color should match the chosen accent color for interactive and selected states.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout for notes, with categories displayed prominently using their assigned color as a background highlight. Ensure adequate spacing for comfortable readability and interaction on various devices.
- Subtle animations for note transitions and actions (e.g., a smooth fade-in for new notes, a gentle color change on hover for interactive elements). Avoid overly distracting animations.
